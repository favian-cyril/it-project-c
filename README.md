Introduction
---------

We choose this project because usually people do not prepare or shop for the ingredients
before cooking for everyday needs. They tend to use the ingredients available at home.
Many people also do not remember their favourite recipe by heart, this could lead to
difficulty of finding the suitable recipe for the ingredients. With this app, worry no
more! You can just input all the ingredients you have and the website will find the
perfect recipe for you. The search could also be tailored to match each individual needs.
This app is also ideal for all college students who have limited ingredients for cooking.
